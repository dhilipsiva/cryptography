Exclusive or, often called ”XOR”, is a Boolean binary operator that is true when either the first input or the second input, but not both, are true.

```
A ⊕ B = AB' + A'B

      (or)

A ⊕ B = (A+B)(A'+B')
```

So,

```
0 ⊕ 0 = 0 
0 ⊕ 1 = 1
1 ⊕ 0 = 1 
1 ⊕ 1 = 0
```

And by entension,

```
A ⊕ A = 0
A ⊕ 0 = A
A ⊕ 1 = A'
```
